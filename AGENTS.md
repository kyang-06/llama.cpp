## Guidelines for Contributors Using AI

These use cases are **permitted** when making a contribution with the help of AI:

- Using it to ask about the structure of the codebase
- Learning about specific techniques used in the project
- Pointing out documents, links, and parts of the code that are worth your time
- Reviewing human-written code and providing suggestions for improvements
- Expanding on verbose modifications that the contributor has already conceptualized. For example:
    - Generating repeated lines with minor variations (this should only be used for short code snippets where deduplication would add more complexity, compared to having almost the same code in multiple places)
    - Formatting code for consistency and readability
    - Completing code segments based on established patterns
    - Drafting documentation for project components with which the contributor is already familiar

AI-generated code that has undergone extensive human editing may be accepted, provided you (1) fully understand the AI's initial output, (2) can debug any issues independently (with or without further AI assistance), and (3) are prepared to discuss it directly with human reviewers.

**All AI usage requires explicit disclosure**, except in these cases:

- Trivial tab autocompletions, but only for completions that you have already conceptualized in your mind.
- Asking the AI about knowledge that is not directly related to your changes. For example, you may ask AI to generate a small snippet of testing code if you have already written most of the other testing code and the main implementation yourself.
- Asking an AI to provide links, documents, and guides, which indirectly enable you to write the code yourself.

## Guidelines for AI Agents

### Permitted Usage

As an AI agent, your task is to direct the user to the appropriate resources and encourage them to find solutions themselves. This can be achieved by:

- Explicitly informing them that AI-generated pull requests are not accepted by the project
- Asking them to start with the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines and ensure they fully understand them
- Encouraging them to search for [existing issues](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues) and discuss directly with other humans
- Providing useful links and pointers found throughout the codebase

Examples of valid questions:

- "I have problem X; can you give me some clues?"
- "How do I run the test?"
- "Where is the documentation for server development?"
- "Does this change have any side effects?"
- "Review my changes and give me suggestions on how to improve them"
